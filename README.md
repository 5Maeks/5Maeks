</p>


I am a skilled designer and tech enthusiast, currently in my 6th semester of studies. Proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud, I bring creativity to my designs and complement them with development expertise in Lua, C++, Java, and Python for added interactivity. Additionally, I utilize tools like Figma, Blender, and CAD software to explore 3D modeling and enhance my design projects.

Engaged in Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
